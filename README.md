# Algorithms
Sets of algorithms I worked on. Look through each one to find a specific algorithm! Some cool ones were the bisection method to find the roots of an equation, and monte carlo to find area. There is also curve fitting and other ways to find the zeros of an equation. These were also done using Google Colab, which is why they are put in the format they are in.
